## Hi there

I'm a **software engineering student** with a strong interest in **game development** and interactive systems.

I mainly work with **Unity (C#)** and **C++**, and I also have several years of experience with **web development** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

For 2.5 years, I founded and taught a **game design course** at a folk high school, helping grow it from an elective into a core subject. Teaching and building games have both been important parts of how I learn and work.
